A history of markup languages
=============================

By Tibs / Tony Ibbs, for PyConUK 2017

Written using reStructuredText_.  Presented using hovercraft_.

.. _hovercraft: https://github.com/regebro/hovercraft


.. |TeX| replace:: TeX

.. |LaTeX| replace:: LaTeX

.. If using beamer, I might do:
..
.. .. role: latex(raw)
..    :format: latex
..
.. .. |TeX| replace:: :latex:`{\TeX}`
..
.. .. |LaTeX| replace:: :latex:`{\LaTeX}`
..
.. or so I think

.. note:: A summary of some of the more obvious bits of the history of
  document markup.

  Specifically ignoring anything that isn't just text (so, music, mathematics,
  diagrams, bibliographies, indices, etc.).

Timeline
--------

* 1960s TYPSET and RUNOFF, GML
* 1970s roff, runoff, nroff/troff, |TeX| in SAIL
* 1980s Scribe, |TeX| in WEB/Pascal, |LaTeX|, Postscript, SGML, TEI
* 1990s HTML, setext, Docbook, WikiWikiWeb, StructuredText, XML
* 2000s reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, markdown

.. note:: There's a lot to cover, even so.

  The longer notes in the github repository have more detail, and give links
  to interesting pages on the web.

Categories of markup
--------------------

1. Presentational
2. Semantic
3. Lightweight

.. note::

  Presentational: how the text should be presented, e.g., as a man page, on a
  screen, or on a typeset page.
  
  Even at the beginning of our timeline, people had access to typesetters, and
  wanted to drive them.

  Semantic: marking up the meaning of the text.

  One of the important early realisations was that even presentation benefits
  from some degree of semantics - i.e., "heading", not "font X at size Y in
  bold".

  Lightweight: simple to type, and hopefully easier to read. Hence also
  the sub-category Readable plaintext.

  Obviously a markup may span categories.

  Separately, "static" markup (e.g., HTML) versus "programmable" (wikipedia:
  "procedural") markup (e.g., |TeX|).

1964: RUNOFF
------------

1964 RUNOFF *Presentational*

Jerome H. Saltzer for CTSS (Compatible Time Sharing System)

Ported to BCPL and then Multics. Ancestor to roff.

This example is (more or less) from the original TYPSET/RUNOFF documentation.

Commands starting with a dot in the first column, and could be abbreviated.

1969: GML / 1986: SGML
----------------------

*DTD for a list* and then *such a list*

1969 GML, 1986 SGML *Semantic* and *"meta"* (DTDs)

GML (Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher, Raymond Lorie) at IBM. 

[Standard] Generalised Markup Language.

A mechanism for *describing* markup languages. Use of the DTD.

SGML uses DTDs (Document Type Definitions) to describe the set of
markup declarations that form a *document type* (e.g., SGML itself, XML,
HTML).

Shown is a DTD fragment for defining a simple list, and an example of the
list structure described.

Sensibly, SGML came with a "starter set" drafted by Joan Smith and
Janet Vandore.

SGML allowed the definition of elements that were implicitly closed by
another element - e.g., <li> and <p> in HTML. *Can the <item> elements
here be closed implicitly?*

1970s: roff, nroff, troff, groff
--------------------------------

1970s \*roff *Presentational*. Still in use (as 1990: groff)

Started as a transliteration of the BCPL version of runoff, for UNIX,
around 1970.

The example is a (fake) man page, using the ``man`` macro package from
Lars Wirzenius' `Writing manual pages`_

.TH = title, .SH = sub-heading, .B = bold, other font usages (e.g., normal
font and underlining) are indicated by the \\f sequences.

.. _`Writing manual pages`: https://liw.fi/manpages/,

1977/1978: |TeX|
----------------

1977/1978 |TeX|

*Presentational with semantic leanings*. Programmable. Still in use.

Designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth.

Driven by the need to guarantee accurate typesetting of mathematics.

In serious use of |TeX|, one starts by defining lots of useful
commands - although `the TeXbook`_ has many useful ideas one can copy.

.. _`The TeXbook`: http://www.ctex.org/documents/shredder/src/texbook.pdf

1980: Scribe
------------

1980 Scribe *Presentational*, and maybe also programmable

Described in Brian Reid's 1980 doctoral dissertation at Carnegie Mellon
University. Lisp based.

Similar systems still appear to exist.

Note the two representations - the second one being more lisp-like.

**Maybe** could drop this slide as well, although I'd rather not.

Also, need to check if it is "programmable".

1984: Postscript
----------------

1984 Postscript *Presentational*, and programmable. Still in use.

Created at Adobe Systems by John Warnock, Charles Geschke, Doug Brotz, Ed
Taft and Bill Paxton from 1982 to 1984.

Not really intended to be written by people.

Similar to Forth.

This is the example on the Wikipedia page.

**Maybe** drop this, as it's not a form aimed at human use.

1987: TEI
---------

1987 TEI *Semantic*. Still in use today.

"The mission of the Text Encoding Initiative is to develop and maintain a
set of high-quality guidelines for the encoding of humanities texts, and to
support their use by a wide community of projects, institutions, and
individuals"

Some mark up of the start of Swinburne's Sestina, showing the working of the
ryhming scheme - ``rhyme="ababab"`` and then on each line the rhyming word
and which part (a, b) of the rhyming scheme it is.

Taken from the poetry examples at `TEI By Example`_.

.. _`TEI by example`: http://teibyexample.org/examples/TBED04v00.htm

1991: HTML
----------

1991 HTML *Presentational*. Still in use today (although rather altered).

Tim Berners-Lee, at CERN, specified HTML and wrote browser and server
software in late 1990. The "HTML Tags" document was first mentioned on the
internet in 1991.

HTML 2.0 was published as IETF RFC 1866 in 1995

Yes, that is the same example as from the "using a DTD" page.

HTML (at least until HTML5) is an SGML document type - an SGML application

1991: setext
------------

1991 setext *Presentational*. Lightweight.

Ian Feldman, for use in writing the TidBITs electronic newsletter.

Partly a reaction to SGML. Clearly influential on
all of the succeeding lightweight markups.

Same year as HTML

Note: body text indented. Underlining indicated by something like
underlining (but nb: underlining *should* mean italics).

Two dots for comments or special meaning.

Unclear if lists actually were supported. Specification not very clear -
really just what he needed for his own purposes.

  **Maybe** add an example of a link?

1991: Docbook
-------------

1991 Docbook *Semantic*. Still in use today.

"A semantic markup language for technical documentation"

However, partly semantic in the same way that |LaTeX| is used - often also for
presentational purposes (but not *necessarily*).

Same year as HTML and setext.

Example of Docbook 4.3 from
http://www.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/~giurca/tutorials/DocBook/index.htm

Before Docbook 5, an SGML language, defined by a DTD, and then later with
an XML variant (if I've got that right).

DocBook 5 is an XML language, formally defined by a RELAX NG schema with
integrated Schematron rules.

1994/1995: wikiwikiweb
----------------------

**skippable** wikiwikiweb

1994/1995 wikiwikiweb *Presentational*

The first wiki, invented by Ward Cunningham

I think that newlines within a paragraph are ignored, but it's hard  to
tell.

The lack of capability is deliberate, aiming to promote a particular style
of discourse:

   "This wiki is quite bare bones, and intentionally so. Less formatting
   means you have to concentrate on saying things carefully and clearly.
   Content over form."


1996: StructuredText
--------------------

1996 StructuredText *Presentational*. Lightweight.

Created by Jim Fulton of Digital Creations (later Zope Foundation) for use
in Zope.

Significant indentation - good idea in a programming language.

A heading is a heading because it is followed by a non-heading (!)

1997: XML
---------

1997 XML *Semantic*.

Extensible Markup Language

wikipedia: "XML is an application profile of SGML"

No example because there is no "default" XML - a schema is needed.

A simpler subset of SGML, which makes parsers easier to write. Other SGML
based tools (TEI, Docbook, HTML itself) have generally moved towards using
XML rather than SGML in their specification.

XML was compiled by a working group of eleven members,[30] supported by a
(roughly) 150-member Interest Group.

**If this is kept** it needs to be a very brief slide. On the other hand,
I think it is useful as a marker, given how XML is important to the SGML
world.

2001/2002: reStructuredText
---------------------------

2001/2002 reStructuredText *Presentational*. Lightweight.

David Goodger had a professional background in SGML.

Original mailing of the idea to the Doc-Sig was in Nov 2000

Readable is the main aim.

Output agnostic.

Sphinx was first introduced as a means of using reStructuredText to write
the Python documenation, instead of |LaTeX|.

Well specified, allowing other implementations which behave in the same way.

-----

2002: Asciidoc
--------------

2002 Asciidoc *Presentational*. Lightweight.

Stuart Rackham

Aimed specifically as a lightweight way of producing docbook.

Well specified, allowing other implementations which behave in the same way.

The original Asciidoc implementation was written in Python in 2002.

Asciidoctor came out in 2013, and is written in Ruby.

2004: markdown
--------------

2004 markdown *Presentation*. Lightweight.

John Gruber, collaborating with Aaron Swartz on the syntax

Yes, I know headings can be underline as well, but I've never seen
anyone actually doing that.

Aimed at producing HTML.

From the syntax page: "Markdownâ€™s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be
used as a format for *writing* for the web." Their emphasis.

Poorly specified. Ambiguous.
Allows embedded HTML.
Most implementations extend it, incompatibly.

Very successful because (the most popular variants) hit a good compromise on
the simplicity/capability curve.
