1994: POD
---------

::

  =pod

  =head1 DESCRIPTION

  This is not I<really> representative of POD usage.

  =over 2

  =item This is a list item.

  =item This is another list item.

  =back

  =cut

.. note:: 1994 POD *Presentational*. Still in use today.

  Perl's "Plain Old Documentation".

  Same year as wikiwikiweb

  An example of markup to a specific purpose, and clearly very successful.

  Note that the blank lines are required around the POD commands.

  I don't think you can do multi-paragraph list items. The POD definitions
  contains ambuguities, although how to handle some of them is explained in
  the POD documentation.

1995: Javadoc
-------------

::

  /**
   * Short one line description.
   * <p>
   * Longer description. If there were any, it would be here.
   * <p>
   * And even more explanations to follow in consecutive
   * paragraphs separated by HTML paragraph breaks.
   *
   * @param  variable Description text text text.
   * @return Description text text text.
   */
  public int methodName (...) {
      // ...
  }

.. note::  **skippable** javadoc

  1995 javadoc *Presentational*. Still in use today.

  Has never specified the subset of HTML it allows.
